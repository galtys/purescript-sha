# purescript-crypt-sha
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/throughnothing/purescript-sha.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/throughnothing/purescript-sha)

This is a [jsSHA](https://caligatio.github.io/jsSHA/) wrapper for purescript,
which implements the entire family of SHA hashes, as well as HMAC functions.

The [jsSHA](https://caligatio.github.io/jsSHA/) javascript is 100% cross-browser
compatible, and works with Node.js.

This wrapper currently only supports SHA-256, but more may be supported in the
future.
